# IF ELSE AND ELIF IN PYTHON
# If else and elif statements are a multiway decision taken by our program due to certain conditions in our code. 


# Syntax: 
# if (condition1): # if condition1 is True 
# print ("yes") 
# elif(condition2): # if condition2 is True  
# print("no") 
# else:             
# otherwise 
# print("maybe")                            


# CODE EXAMPLE. 
# a=22 
# if(a>9): 
# print("greater") 
# else: 
# print("lesser")


# RELATIONAL OPERATORS 
# Relational Operators are used to evaluate conditions inside the if statements. 
# Some examples of relational operators are: 
# ==: equals. 
# > =: greater than/ equal to. 
# < =: lesser than/ equal to.



# LOGICAL OPERATORS 
# In python logical operators operate on conditional statements. For Example: 
# • and – true if both operands are true else false. 
# • or – true if at least one operand is true or else false. 
# • not – inverts true to false & false to true. 



# ELIF CLAUSE 
# elif in python means [else if]. An if statements can be chained together with a lot of these elif statements followed by an else statement. 

# if (condition1): 
#code 
# elif (condition2):   # this ladder will stop once a condition in an if or 
# elif is met. 
#code 
# elif(condition3): 
#code  
# else: 
#code 


# IMPORTANT NOTES: 
# 1. There can be any number of elif statements. 
# 2. Last else is executed only if all the conditions inside elifs fail.
